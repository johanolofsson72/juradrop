# Specification Quality Checklist: Strict Content-Security-Policy

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-02
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The spec deliberately names the localhost Ollama endpoint and CSP directives at the conceptual level (allowed-origin sets) without prescribing the exact policy string — that is a planning/implementation detail resolved by inspecting the built bundle.
- Full track chosen for the security-invariant (Allium localhost-only) and egress-probe coverage, even though the state machine is trivial and TLA+ is expected to hit its triviality gate.
- All items pass on iteration 1.
