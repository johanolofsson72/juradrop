# Specification Quality Checklist: Frontend Playwright smoke tests

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-02
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

> Note: this is a test-infrastructure feature, so the "user" is the developer/CI runner and the integration surface (Tauri IPC contract, Vite, Chromium) is intrinsic to the requirement rather than incidental implementation detail. Tool names are named because they ARE the subject of the spec, not a chosen implementation of a tool-agnostic need.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`.
- All items pass. The spec is ready for `/speckit-clarify`.
